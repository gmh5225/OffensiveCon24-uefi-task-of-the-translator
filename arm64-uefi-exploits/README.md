### [quinearm64.S](arm64-uefi-quine/quinearm64.S):     
arm64 assembly source code for self-replicating UEFI application           
#### [QuineArm64.inf](arm64-uefi-quine/QuineArm64.inf):     
INF file for building QuineArm64 UEFI app using edk2 build system      
      
The UEFI apps for both the final arm64 assembly solution and the original cross-compiled C solution are in the directory UEFI_bb_disk:       
[QuineArm64.efi](UEFI_bb_disk/QuineArm64.efi): UEFI app QuineArm64.efi -- built from arm64 asm source code [quinearm64.S](arm64-uefi-quine/quinearm64.S)      
[UEFISelfRep.efi](UEFI_bb_disk/UEFISelfRep.efi): UEFI app UEFISelfRep.efi -- built from C source code, cross-compiled for aarch64 architecture using edk2 build system      
      
#### [poc_arm64.py](poc_arm64.py):   
Python script to test arm64 self-rep app in QEMU; includes option for running in QEMU with GDB debugging session
